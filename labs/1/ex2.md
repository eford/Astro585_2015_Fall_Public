# Astro 585 Lab 1, Exercise 2

# Setup/Make sure you can use Julia 

You'll need to be able to use Julia both in the Osmond Lab and on your own (i.e., you personal laptop, a departmental workstation, or one of the computers in the Astro undergrad computer lab).  

Note that there are multiple intefaces for using Julia.  For this week's lab, you'd be fine using the simple command line/REPL interface, also known as the REPL (read-eval-print-loop) interface.  But for future assignments, and particularly the project, you'll probably want to use the Juno Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and/or the IJulia web-based notebook interface.  

All three interface are installed in both the Osmond Mac lab and the Astro UG labs.  

As each location is slightly different, I've prepared separate instructions for each location:
* [Getting Started using Julia/IJulia/Juno in the PSU Osmond Computer Lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iG4WR-9vJXj38LHcPk_GecSzxl7NN_SBImcy-cFjqEM/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Getting Started with Julia/IJulia/Juno in the Astro 537 Computer Lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1glbK2TlP77Tk3FJHvCHDB9QCtMfNCsb1476-afm-R0o/edit?usp=sharing)

There are also instructions online for setting up each of these on your own machines:
* Download [Julia (the language)](http://julialang.org/downloads/)
* Download [Juno](http://junolab.org/docs/install.html) (a prepackaged version of the LightTable IDE with plugin and customization for Julia)
* [Installing IJulia on one of your own machines](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) (note that this requires having IPython setup correctly)

Using some machine, and one of the interfaces, start Julia.
Enter a simple command like `1+2` followed by `Shift-Enter` and see if it returns `3`.  If so, you're good to go.  If not, then ask someone for help.

You can exit the REPL version using `quit()`.  Exit Juno by closing the app.  Or "shutdown" the IJulia notebook from the webpage listing the various notebooks availiable.
