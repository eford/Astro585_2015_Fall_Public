1.  Developing a Well Tested Function
2.  Benchmarking Code, Regression Tests & Algorithmic Optimizations
3.  Large Linear Algebra Problems
4.  Numerical Stability of Integrators  (as time permits)

## Getting started with lab 2

First, you'll want to merge the changes that I've made to the course's template git repository into your local repository.
To do that, you'll first want to change into a directory that's part of a local git repository.
Then tell git that you want your local repository to know about another remote repository (which we'll call "upstream") with the following command.
```
> git remote add upstream git@github.com:eford/PsuAstro585.git
```

Remember that you can "pull" changes from your remote repository into your local repository with the command.
```
> git pull
```
When you don't specify a repository after the pull command, then by default git uses the "origin" repository that you specified when you issued the `git clone` command to setup your local repository.

Now, we'll "pull" in changes from the upstream repository with the command
```
> git pull upstream master
```

If all goes smoothly, then you'll now have new files in the labs/2 subdirectory.

If you run into problems, you can ask for help or just go view the files via a web browser at github https://github.com/eford/PsuAstro585.
