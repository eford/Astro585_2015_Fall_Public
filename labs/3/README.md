## Work on Class Project Proposal

You may a project proposal that closely relates to your research interests.  You are strongly encouraged to discuss it with the instructor far enough in advance of the deadline, that you can refine or change your plans prior to the proposal due date.  If you have no idea and would like the instructor to suggest a project, then let the instructor know by the end of the first week.  In either case, the written proposal should include:
- the project goal, 
- a description of the inputs, 
- a description of the outputs, 
- a plan for how you will test your code, 
- a discussion of the relevant range of problem sizes (typically between a sentance and paragraph), and
- what computer architectures, programming languages, and libraries you will use, as well as an explanation of your choices (especially if you're proposing anything non-standard).
