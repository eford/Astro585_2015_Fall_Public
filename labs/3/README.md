## Work on Class Project Proposal

You may propose a project that closely relates to your research interests.  You are strongly encouraged to discuss it with the instructor far enough in advance of the deadline, that you can refine or change your plans prior to the proposal due date.  If you have no idea and would like the instructor to suggest a project, then let the instructor know by the end of the first week.  In either case, the written proposal should include:
- the project goal, 
- a description of the inputs, 
- a description of the outputs, 
- a plan for how you will test your code, 
- a discussion of the relevant range of problem sizes (typically between a sentance and paragraph), and
- what computer architectures you will use (see note #1 below),
- what programming language(s) you will use,
- any libraries you will use, and
- if you will be collaborating with anyone else on your project.

Notes
1. For class projects, students are to parallelize their code for: 1) a multi-core workstation and 2) one additional architecture.  
Examples of other architectures include: 
  - a distributed memory system (e.g., one of the [Penn State clusters](https://ics.psu.edu/advanced-cyberinfrastructure/ics-aci-infrastructure/)), 
  - a many-core accelerator (e.g., [GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/what-cuda) or [Intel Phi](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/high-performance-computing/high-performance-xeon-phi-coprocessor-brief.html)), or 
  - on the cloud (e.g., [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [Domino](https://www.dominodatalab.com/cloud)).
If you're using Julia, then I'd guess than one of the Penn State clusters or the Domino cloud would be the least work.  Of course, if using another architecture is more advantageous for your research, then you should give that serious consideration.
2. This is most relevant if you're proposing something non-standard, e.g. using Python for significant computations, an Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor, some library that you'll need help installing.
