# PsuAstro585:  Lab 4  
# Performance Comparisons (1/2): Profiling, Loops vs Vectorized vs Map

## Exercises
1.  Profiling
2.  Loop vs Vectorized vs Map vs MapReduce vs Devectorized

## Class Project
Make sure to save some time to start working on your class project.  If you're starting from scratch, then think about the big questions (programming at large).  What language(s), libraries, data structures and algorithms will you use?  Try to start writing and testing some code (think back to reading and discussion of programming in the middle).  Remember to commit often.  Once you've finished coding for your project for the week, write a few sentances reflecting on how it's going.  Feel free to include any question about strategy or to note something you've come to appreciate.
