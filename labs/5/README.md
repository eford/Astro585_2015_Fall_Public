# PsuAstro585:  Lab 5  
# Performance Comparisons (2/2): Memory Access & Object Oriented Programming

## Exercises
1.  Dense Matrix Multiply
2.  Loop vs Vectorized vs Map vs MapReduce vs Devectorized

## Class Project
Make sure to save some time to start working on your class project.  Hopefully, you've already thought about the big questions (programming at large).  I'd encourage to make significant progress writing and testing code (think back to reading and discussion of programming in the middle) and starting to fill in some of the details.  Remember to commit often.  Once you've finished coding for your project for the week, write a few sentances reflecting on how it's going.  Feel free to include any question about strategy or to note something you've come to appreciate.
