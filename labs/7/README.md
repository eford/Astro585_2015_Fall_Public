# PSU Astro585:  Lab 7  
# Parallel Computing:  Distributed Memory Clusters

## Exercises
1.  Running a job on a Lion-X Cluster

2.  Distributed Computing using Julia's DistributedArrays

3.  Continue making progress on parallelzing the code for your class project.  Ideally, you'd adapt at least one function for your class project, so it can be parallelized using DistributedArrays.  Once you've finished coding for your project for the week, write a few sentences reflecting on how it's going.  Feel free to include any questions about strategy or to note something you've come to appreciate the value of while applying what you've learned in the class.
